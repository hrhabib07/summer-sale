# vanilla JavaScript project - Geometry Genius

## Overview
This project is all about making a website that looks good on any device, like your phone or computer. We're using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI), and vanilla JavaScript. Before, we focused on how the website looks, but now we're adding cool stuff with JavaScript to make it more fun and interactive. Think of it like adding magic to our website! Our main goal is still to make sure the website looks great on all screens, but now we're also making it do cool tricks with JavaScript to make it even better.
